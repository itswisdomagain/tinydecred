    MsgVersion implements the Message API and represents a Decred version
    message.  It is used for a peer to advertise itself as soon as an outbound
    connection is made.  The remote peer then uses this information along with
    its own to negotiate.  The remote peer must then respond with a version
    message of its own containing the negotiated values followed by a verack
    message (MsgVerAck).  This exchange must take place before any further
    communication is allowed to proceed.
